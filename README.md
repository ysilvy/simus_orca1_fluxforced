# simus_orca1_fluxforced

Force the ocean in NEMO3.6 (no sea ice) with fixed fluxes at the ocean surface. Here you will find the modified code to put in MY_SRC, as well as the namelist_cfg for the forced simulations. Detailed instructions concerning the modifications in each routine can be found in the document "Forcage_en_flux_ORCA1" (only in French for now).

The configuration was developped in the context of my PhD work, with the help of Clément Rousset, Christian Ethé and Gurvan Madec (LOCEAN-IPSL).
